**Python**
1. Make sure you have python installed. If not go here [https://www.python.org/downloads/] to install it and set up in your evironmental variables. 

2. To verify it successfully installed open up a new terminal window and run [py --version] or [python --version] (which ever works)

**Clone the Repository**
1. git clone https://github.com/Amedi13/Weather-Tracker-App.git 

2. cd Weather-Tracker-App

**Virtual Environment** 
Note: It’s recommended to use a virtual environment so dependencies don’t install globally.

1. Open up a new terminal window and run *pip install virtualenv*

2. to verify the Virtual Environment was installed succesfully navigate by running *py -m venv env* and then running
*.\env\Scripts\Activate*

**Backend Set Up (Django)**

1. Make sure you are in the Virtual Environment, and run *pip install django* in a terminal window

2. to start the server navigate to the directory you made in the previous step and run *py manage.py runserver*

3. Open your browser and go to:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    If you see the Django welcome page or your Weather Tracker app, everything is set up correctly ✅.
